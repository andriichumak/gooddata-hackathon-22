## How to start the demo

1. Install deps with `yarn` command. Might need to [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) first.
2. Start local Docker Tiger image. This should also create a `demo_ws` workspace for you.
3. Use scripts from [`./scripts/simple_dashboard.http`](./scripts/simple_dashboard.http) file to create a new dashboard with special layout format.
4. Run `yarn start`. Wait a bit, it will open a browser window with the demo automatically.
